## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Local Setup

To set up and run Bazaar-Buddy on your local development environment, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/JadenBritto/Bazaar-Buddy.git](https://github.com/JadenBritto/Bazaar-Buddy.git)
    cd Bazaar-Buddy
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure Firebase:**
    * **Create a Firebase Project:** Navigate to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
    * **Enable Services:** Within your Firebase project, enable **Firestore Database** and **Authentication** (e.g., Email/Password provider).
    * **Obtain Firebase Config:** In your Firebase project settings, locate and copy your web app's configuration object. It will resemble:
        ```javascript
        const firebaseConfig = {
          apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
          authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
          projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
          storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
          messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
          appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
        };
        ```
    * **Create `.env` File:** In the root directory of your `Bazaar-Buddy` project, create a file named `.env` and populate it with your Firebase credentials:
        ```
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
        REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
        ```
    * **Configure Firestore Security Rules:** Implement the following security rules in your Firebase Console to manage data access. These rules allow authenticated users to read and write their own private data and access public data.

        **For Public Data (e.g., shared lists, if implemented):**
        ```firestore
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            match /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/{collection}/{document} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        **For Private Data (e.g., user-specific shopping lists):**
        ```firestore
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/{collection}/{document} {
              allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
            }
          }
        }
        ```

4.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    The application will launch in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
